**Non-monogamy**

Loving more than one person. It can be romantic (polyamory) or sexual (open relationship / swinging)

**Relationship Escalator**

The expectation (and pressure) we have when we are in a romantic relationship - We are suppose to date, than become exclusive, than move in together, have kids, etc.

**Relationship Anarchy**

The idea that each relationship is unique, and we can't compare one relationship to another and can't put labels on it. For example - just because we are dating someone romanticaly, doesn't mean that this relationship is more or less important than a relationship that doesn't have the romantic element in it. We also avoid naming our relationships, so we don't use the term boyfriend, lover, partner etc. Naming your relationship might force you to fit your emotions, thoughs, and actions into the name you gave your relationship but in reality your feelings should have room to change and evolve.

**Compersion**

Feeling of joy when someone else is happy. It's the flip side of jealousy.
